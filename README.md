# Welcome to Clouds Project
SHEDS (Simple and Secure Cost Efficient Data Storage in Heterogeneous Multiple Cloud)
## Description
In recent scenario of IT & Technology each and every organization wants to host their data into the cloud due to availability and reliability in other terms more storage and less maintenance cost. However, facing the numerous cloud vendors as well as their diverse pricing policies, customers may well be baffled with which cloud(s) are suitable for their purpose in terms of less bandwidth cost and cheap storage. We are proposing a novel method SHEDS (Simple and Secure Cost Efficient Data Storage in Heterogeneous Multiple Cloud) for data hosting. It basically works in two principles. The first one is selecting sundry clouds which is suitable for the purpose and a proper redundancy algorithm by which we can curtail the storage cost and assured availability. The second is set off transition process to revamp data according to the change in data access pattern and pricing of clouds. This scheme also eliminates the vendor locking scheme due to the use of multiple clouds.
